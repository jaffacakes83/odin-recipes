    <h1>Cheese</h1>

    <p>The written sources mention cheese in different situations. In old nordic litterature fresh cheese in recommended for poor health, for healing wounds and against scurvy and kidney stones. There are also numerous laws underlining the importance of cheese and cheese production. According to a law from the end of the 12th century people in Bohuslän were required to make cheese for the Church and the poor with "all milk gotten the friday before the Jons service" (day of John the Baptist). In the Halland list of Valdemar's property book you may read that cheese was used as taxes to the Danish crown, and according to a statute from 1346 farmers on Öland  were required to leave groceries as altar gifts at every church feast - including cheese.

        The archeaological finds indicate that cheese making took place in Scandinavia already during the Roman Iron Age, 0 - 400 AD. In Sweden and Denmark finds from this period include hollowed clay jars assumed to be used for cheese making. Excavations in Lund have revealed a tool that has been identified as a cheese chute made of oak, used to produce cheese. It has been dated to the time period 1020-50 AD. Cheese mass has been placed on it and then kneaded until the whey poured out of the groove below. The whey was then used for cooking and baking.
        <br />
        Milk from cows, sheep and goats has been used (and still is used) for making cheese. Both clabber cheese and rennet cheese was made. Clabber cheese is made by heating clabber. Rennet cheese is made from sweet heated milk where rennet is added. It has been assumed that clabber cheese is older than rennet cheese, from before the latter took over.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>10 litres of unpasteurized milk</li>
        <li>5 litres of old-fashioned milk</li>
        <li>Cheese rennet</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Brine</li>
        <li>Mead</li>
        <li>Spices</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 10 litres of unpasteurized milk to 38 degrees celsius in two batches. Afterward pour 2 tablespoons of cheese rennet into each milk batch. Rennet is an enzyme from the calf belly mucous membrane that cause the milk to solidify.  It can be purchased at an apothecary. Instead of renner you may try to use plants with coagulating properties like thistles, artichokes, buttercups and butterwort. Yellow bedstraw is noted as a particularly strong option. The coagulating properties of these plants are not clearly defined, thus it may be risky to use vegetable rennet in these situations. A defining characteristic of western cheese culture is and has long been, rennet of animal origin.</li>
        <li>When the rennet has been added the mix should be left to solidify for 30 minutes. To remove the whey from the curd the mass is poured into a colander that is rotated around the edge. Much of the whey is extracted in this manner. The now fairly solid curd is placed in a towel and squeezed until all the whey is removed. Repeat the above with 5 litres of old-fashioned milk.</li>
        <li>Add your desired spices before the curd is completely dry. Salt is not only used to enhance the taste but also improve durability and prevent mold.</li>
        <li>When the curd is ready it should be swept into a dry towel and placed in a mould. The towel should be changed daily. The cheese should be turned every morning and evening for at least 3-4 weeks. If there is any mold it should be cut off immediately. Keep the cheese on plates with weights on</li>
        <li>The cheese should be preserved for at least 5 weeks before it is ready to be eaten. The longer time the tastier the cheese. It should be kept cool but not cold. The cheese could be kept in a turned off refrigerator, which has the added advantage of keeping it safe from insects and rodents.</li>
