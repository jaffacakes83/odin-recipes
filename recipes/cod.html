    <h1>Cooked Cod with Butter and Mustard</h1>
    <img src="../images/cod.jpg" alt="Viking Cod">
    <p>The Vikings had a meat diet based on pig meat. Sheep meat, fish and game also played a large role. The seal in particular bears mention, which left meat, blood and fat. Clams and other shellfish occasionally made for a variation in diet.
        <br/>
        Some meat was eaten fresh, but most was preserved in some way - drying, souring, buried by digging it down, smoking, salting and during the cold season even freezing. The majority of the meat and fish was boiled in iron pots hung in a chain over the fire, though clay jars were also common for cooking.</p>
