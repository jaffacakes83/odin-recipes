    <h1>Cheese</h1>
    <img src="../images/cheese.jpg" alt="Viking Cheese">
    <p>The Vikings had a meat diet based on pig meat. Sheep meat, fish and game also played a large role. The seal in particular bears mention, which left meat, blood and fat. Clams and other shellfish occasionally made for a variation in diet.
        <br/>
        Some meat was eaten fresh, but most was preserved in some way - drying, souring, buried by digging it down, smoking, salting and during the cold season even freezing. The majority of the meat and fish was boiled in iron pots hung in a chain over the fire, though clay jars were also common for cooking.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>10 litres of unpasteurized milk</li>
        <li>5 litres of old-fashioned milk</li>
        <li>Cheese rennet</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Brine</li>
        <li>Mead</li>
        <li>Spices</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 10 litres of unpasteurized milk to 38 degrees celsius in two batches. Afterward pour 2 tablespoons of cheese rennet into each milk batch. Rennet is an enzyme from the calf belly mucous membrane that cause the milk to solidify.  It can be purchased at an apothecary. Instead of renner you may try to use plants with coagulating properties like thistles, artichokes, buttercups and butterwort. Yellow bedstraw is noted as a particularly strong option. The coagulating properties of these plants are not clearly defined, thus it may be risky to use vegetable rennet in these situations. A defining characteristic of western cheese culture is and has long been, rennet of animal origin.</li>
        <li>When the rennet has been added the mix should be left to solidify for 30 minutes. To remove the whey from the curd the mass is poured into a colander that is rotated around the edge. Much of the whey is extracted in this manner. The now fairly solid curd is placed in a towel and squeezed until all the whey is removed. Repeat the above with 5 litres of old-fashioned milk.</li>
        <li>Add your desired spices before the curd is completely dry. Salt is not only used to enhance the taste but also improve durability and prevent mold.</li>
        <li>When the curd is ready it should be swept into a dry towel and placed in a mould. The towel should be changed daily. The cheese should be turned every morning and evening for at least 3-4 weeks. If there is any mold it should be cut off immediately. Keep the cheese on plates with weights on</li>
        <li>The cheese should be preserved for at least 5 weeks before it is ready to be eaten. The longer time the tastier the cheese. It should be kept cool but not cold. The cheese could be kept in a turned off refrigerator, which has the added advantage of keeping it safe from insects and rodents.</li>
