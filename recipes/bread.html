    <h1>Ã–landish Frying Pan Bread</h1>
    <img src="../images/bread.jpg" alt="Viking Bread">
    <p>During the Viking Age bread was most often baked in the form of flat cookies on embers, directly on the hearth stone, or on frying pans, flat plates with long shafts that were held over an open hearth. There were also occasional vaulted baking ovens for larger fermented bread.
        <br/>
        The higher up on the societal ladder the finer bread you ate. Flat grain bread was often used as a plate to eat from. The sauce from the food was then sucked into the bread and could be eaten afterward.
        <br/>
        Viking Age bread ingredients: oats, rye, wheat, pea flour, bark, flax seed, bone meal, eel weed, emmer wheat, grains, mashed acorns, hazelnuts, roots and weeds.</p>
